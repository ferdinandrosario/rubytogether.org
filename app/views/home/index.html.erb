  <h1>Ruby Together</h1>
<% end %>

<p>Ruby Together is dedicated to sustaining and improving the tools and infrastructure of the Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>We pool money from <%= link_to "our members", members_path %> to allow <%= link_to "our team", team_path %> to make <%= link_to "improvements", plans_path %> that benefit everyone who uses Ruby. To start with, we're focusing on the <%= link_to "public infrastructure", projects_path %> of the Ruby language.</p>

<p>As a 501(c)(6) non-profit trade association, Ruby Together is run by a <%= link_to "board of directors", team_path %> who decide which projects to fund. When you join us, you'll get a vote in the annual board member election, helping us decide how to spend the money we collect.</p>

<p><%= link_to "Join us today", join_path %> and start making a difference in the future of Ruby!</p>
