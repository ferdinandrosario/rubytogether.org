Thanks for joining Ruby Together.

Your membership dues will be charged automatically every month, and are tax-deductible by anyone using Ruby as part of their business. (Ask your accountant to be sure, may not apply outside the US. YMMV.)

We'll send another email with the receipt for your first payment.

In order to be credited on our members page, just fill in your name on the "manage your membership" page:

<%= membership_url(token: @token) %>
